# What?
These are notes I've taken out of reading this article:
https://blog.ceejbot.com/posts/programming-as-theory-building/

## Notes
>> Programming isn’t about writing the code; it’s about understanding the problem and expressing that understanding through code.

**Coude should:**
> - Explain how the solution relates to the affairs of the world that it helps to handle.
> - Explain why each part of the program is what it is, in other words is able to support the actual program text with a justification of some sort.
> - Respond constructively to any demand for a modification of the program so as to support the affairs of the world in a new manner.

>> we need to have theories of the systems we build and maintain, as well as theories of the pieces of that system.


“the theory of the program” === “a mental model of the system”
