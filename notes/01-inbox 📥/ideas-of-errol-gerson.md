# Errol Gerson ideas

- If you change the way you look at things, things you look at change
- What do you do? How do you do it? Why do you do it? People buy why do you do things, not what do you do
- Why do you want to work for IBM? Reframe: why should I work for you? What was that about me that you invited me to come?
- Fail: first attempt in learning
- Leader: Challenge and support
- Overthinking leads to analysis paralysis
- Solving a problem is 90% shape and understand the problem and 10% solving
- Critical thinking is focused on solving the main thing, the 20%, so that the remaining 80% falls in
- When I get mansplained: you have summarized a lot of important stuff -> then I take the speech and build on top of it
