What I do

People Agility: This looks like understanding and relating to other people to empower collective performance.

“How can I become a leader on my team?”

“What opportunities exist for me at this company and beyond?”

“Where can I improve?”

“What do I want to be when I grow up?” (an especially tricky one!)

leaders can best use competition by encouraging team members to use their strengths “in a way that benefits others as well as themselves.”

Give constructive feedback to your manager about what she’s doing well and where you could use more support.
