ðŸ—³ GOALS THEORY
================

-   **Attainability:** Challenge but not overwhelm

-   **Flexibility:** Have a range of goals

-   **Time:** Reasonable deadlines and allow for process

-   **Process-focus:** Be mindful of the steps along the way

-   **Inspiration:** How do you want to feel

Categories of goals
===================

1.  **Specific:** Measurable and quantifiable. Example: Race completion, finish times, pace, speed, weight, workout consistency

2.  **Non-Specific:** Emotional, subjective process or global. Example: Happiness with yourself, confidence, resilience, stress management, contentment, general well-being

> Professional runner Kara Goucher writes in her bookÂ [_Strong_](https://www.amazon.com/Strong-Runners-Boosting-Confidence-Becoming/dp/1944515593/ref=sr_1_cc_1)Â thatÂ [good goals should consider attainability](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/do-your-goals-need-a-mid-season-reset/)Â (challenge but donâ€™t overwhelm), time (set reasonable deadlines and allow for process), flexibility (have a range of goals), inspiration (how do you want to feel) and process-focus (be mindful of the steps along the way). You can break your goals into two basic categories, quantifiable, specific, measurable goals;Â and non-specific, emotional, subjective process or global goals.

> Specific goals could include race or event completion, race finish times, bike power numbers, pace, speed, weight and general workout consistency. Non-specific goals might include happiness with yourself, confidence, resilience, stress-management, contentment and general well-being. When you write your goals down, it can help to divide them into these two categories.
