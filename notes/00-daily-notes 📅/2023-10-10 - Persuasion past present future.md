Frances Frei's approach to storytelling for persuasion is structured around the past, present, and future framework. Here's a breakdown of how she formulates impactful stories:

**Past**: In the past, it's essential to honor what has happened, both the positive and negative aspects. Acknowledge the history, recognizing that what may have been considered the "good old days" for some might not have been the same for others. This historical perspective sets the stage for the need for change.

**Present**: Focus on the present by providing a clear and compelling change mandate. Explain why change is necessary now and why it can't be postponed. Make it evident to your audience why they need to embrace change immediately. This step requires a convincing case for change.

**Future**: Look to the future and describe what the change will lead to. This vision of the future should be both rigorous and optimistic. It should outline a practical, well-thought-out path forward while maintaining a positive and hopeful outlook. This combination of practicality and optimism creates the necessary structure for a persuasive change story.

By weaving these elements of the past, present, and future into your storytelling, you can effectively communicate the need for change and inspire others to embrace it. This framework provides a comprehensive narrative that guides your audience from understanding the past to envisioning a brighter future.
