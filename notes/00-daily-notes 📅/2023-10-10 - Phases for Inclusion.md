Frances Frei outlines a four-stage framework for fostering inclusion: safe, welcome, celebrated, and championed. Here's a breakdown of these stages:

1. **Safe**: The foundation of inclusion is creating a safe environment where individuals feel secure to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. Safety sets the stage for further progress.
    
2. **Welcome**: Once safety is established, the next stage is to make individuals feel genuinely welcomed. This goes beyond mere tolerance; it involves embracing and appreciating the differences that each person brings.
    
3. **Celebrated**: Moving beyond welcome, the goal is to celebrate the uniqueness of each individual. Rather than focusing solely on commonalities, this stage encourages recognizing and appreciating the distinct perspectives and experiences that diverse individuals bring to the table.
    
4. **Championed**: The final stage involves actively championing individuals. This means advocating for them, especially in situations where their voices may not be heard. It's about supporting and empowering others, both in their presence and absence.
    

The overarching aim is to advance people up the "inclusion dial" without pushing anyone else down. This framework emphasizes the importance of fostering a sense of belonging and value for everyone, recognizing that true inclusion benefits from diversity and should not be achieved at the expense of others. It's a nuanced approach that encourages organizations to navigate the complexities of inclusion effectively.
