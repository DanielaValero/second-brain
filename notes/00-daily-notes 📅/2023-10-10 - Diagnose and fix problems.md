#difficultSituations #problemSolving

Frances Frei's playbook for accelerating excellence in organizations is structured around a weekday calendar. Here's a breakdown of the five steps, from Monday to Friday:

**Monday - Identify Your Real Problem**: Start by identifying the actual underlying problem rather than just addressing the symptoms. It's a day for diagnosis and understanding the root cause.

**Tuesday - Rebuild Trust**: If the problem involves human relationships and trust is broken, focus on rebuilding trust as the core of your solution. Trust is pivotal to effective problem-solving.

**Wednesday - Make New Friends**: To complement your problem-solving efforts, seek out diverse perspectives. Actively engage with people who have different viewpoints. Consider whose perspective is missing and invite them in.

**Thursday - Storytelling**: It's essential to communicate your solutions effectively. Thursday is dedicated to mastering the art of storytelling. Even the best solutions need to be communicated well to have an impact.

**Friday - Move Fast and Fix Things**: Once you've gone through the process of identifying the problem, rebuilding trust, gaining new perspectives, and mastering storytelling, you're now ready to take swift action. Friday represents the day to move quickly and implement your solutions. It's about fixing things efficiently, and this speed is made possible by the thorough work done earlier in the week.

This framework emphasizes the importance of a systematic approach to problem-solving, with each day building upon the progress of the previous one. It culminates in the ability to move fast and effectively resolve issues without causing unnecessary disruption.
