### Architecture advisory forum
A recurrent hour long session to talk about technical architecture or design topics that affect the whole system or multiple systems

One core element: Advice Process

Four supporting elements:

-   Architecture Advisory Forum
-   Lightweight ADRs
-   Team-sourced Principles
-   Your own Tech Radar

Agenda
-   team representatives quickly share new [spikes](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html) (giving early warning of probable future decisions and allow the attendees to share existing knowledge and experience)
-   discussions about each new “proposed” decision (presented by those making the decision, captured ahead of time in the form of an ADR)
-   a re-visit of other decision-statuses (we timebox these, both to limit the window for incoming advice, and also to allow us to revisit a decision which we made with imperfect information)
-   a look at our collective four key metrics, our cloud spend trends, and finally
-   any other business (aka “AOB”)
