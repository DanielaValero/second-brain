## good goal principles 
Example: goals regarning ‚ÄúCollaboration Impact,‚Äù it should:

Be outcome-focused (something tangible exists because of your collaboration)

Be in your control (you can produce it without relying on others‚Äô approval or recognition)

Encourage the right behaviors (clarity, unblock progress, strengthen team delivery)

Be measurable without being purely about vanity metrics

## Types of goals

Goal are everywhere! Goals are linked! There really isn‚Äôt a hard boundary between one type of goal and another type of goal: they‚Äôre all connected.

Learning goals help us focus on what we need to learn

Milestones are generally useful constructs (e.g., milestones for decisions, milestones for defining an opportunity, etc.)

Delivery goals. Hey, without inputs, you have no outputs :)

Initiative goals: the proximate impact of an experiment, initiative, etc.

Launch-related goals, where we begin tackling commercialization, adoption, and other related objectives.

Input goals, which represent increases/decreases in key, stable, actionable inputs

North Star goals‚Äîwhere we want the North Star Metric to be by a certain point in time

Annual goals around key (but lagging) business KPIs, customer outcomes, etc.
