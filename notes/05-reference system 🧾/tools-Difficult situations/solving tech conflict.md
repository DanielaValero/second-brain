#conflictResolution #difficultSituations

- How does your/their solution improve the situation? In what ways does it improve the situation?
- What problem are you trying to solve? What problem do you think they are trying to solve?
- What are you trying to optimise for and what trade-offs are you accepting with your solution? What about their perspective?
- Are you sharing the same assumptions about these trade-offs?
