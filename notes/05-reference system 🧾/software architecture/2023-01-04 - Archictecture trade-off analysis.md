#techniques #softwareArchitecture #tradeOff


Idea
Making technical decisions on architecture requires to specify clearly what the trade offs are. It has been common in  my experience to see technical people making architecture decisions, leaving the trade offs undocumented, and invisible. 

I want to change that for myself now, and for my team.

Techniques
- Qualitative vs quantitative 
- MECE lists
- out of context trap
- model relevant use cases
