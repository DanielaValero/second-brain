Goal:  
To be both _loosely coupled_ and _highly aligned_, we would need to be intentional in how we crafted our interactions with our teams, each other, and across the organization.

* Many unknown unkonws
* Letting problems in teams to arise, collect context
	* case: trying to solve all the problems for the teams, protecting too much to the teams
* Lay groundwork:
	* tai chi vs. kung fu: "Instead of directly attacking a situation, what you really need to do is slowly position everything so that when it is really time to do something, just a light push gets you where you want to go."

We’ve now got a landscape so our discussion can move to “what would be the most effective movement we could make here to ensure we have the best outcome”.

*   _Any of us could do that_: improvements that anyone on the team could action/impediments anyone on the team could remove.
*   _We know someone who knows how to do this_: we know an expert that could make the improvement for us/remove the impediment or could teach us how to do it.
*   _We’d need to try a few things:_ We’re not sure how to act on this and we don’t know anyone who could so we’ll have to experiment.

**Process conflict — How are we doing it?**  
**Relationship conflict — Who are you currently at odds with?**  
**Task Conflict — What are we doing?**  
	-  It includes your desired goals & purpose (outcome) and deliverables (output)


## **Clarifying team & project structure first makes you more successful.**


**Task-related**

*   **Purpose and Goals** (Business & personal) → What problem to solve/outcome to create.
*   **Strength, Assets, Weaknesses & Risks** → What gaps to anticipate, what assets are there?

**Process-related**

*   **Roles & Responsibilities** → Who does what and why?
*   **Methodologies & Tools** → What process procedures to follow?
*   **Communication structures** → Which ways of working define the team?

**Relationship-related**

*   Values and Expectations → What culture should the team live in?
*   Get to know each other → What do we have in common that helps them bond and trust each other?




Solving complexity by introducing complicated workflows and protocols is the road to rigidity. Solving complexity through simplicity, is the way to agility.
