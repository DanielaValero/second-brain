## Early adopter of micro frontend architecture


Initial state:
No processes, no clear roles, no clear tech vision or goal, not enough know-how on the heuristics of building microfrontends

Caused:
Double work, high levels of stress, early symthoms of burnout, conflict among team members, no clear goal or direction, confusion, missed deadlines, deadlines and scope unclear



First Lessons
* People comes first: phychological safety, respect, trust and work-life balance
* Setup clear roles an expectations
* Limit size of teams 
* Setup a default initial process
* Communicate deadlines, and scope clearly


Next lessons
* Setup processes across teams
* Setup communication models across teams
* Engage people by communicating purpose: 
	* not: ship things
	* yes: bring the product to the browser
