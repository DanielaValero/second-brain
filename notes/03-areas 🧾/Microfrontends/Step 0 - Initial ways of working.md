## Early adopter of micro frontend architecture


Initial state:  
No processes, no clear roles, no clear tech vision or goal, not enough know-how on the heuristics of building microfrontends

Caused:  
Double work, high levels of stress, early symthoms of burnout, conflict among team members, no clear goal or direction, confusion, missed deadlines, deadlines and scope unclear



First Lessons
* People comes first: phychological safety, respect, trust and work-life balance
* Setup clear roles an expectations
* Limit size of teams 
* Setup a default initial process
* Communicate deadlines, and scope clearly


Next lessons
* Setup processes across teams
* Setup communication models across teams
* Engage people by communicating purpose: 
	* not: ship things
	* yes: bring the product to the browser



1. Define roles clearly
2. Define career framework
3. Define values:
   1.  “***statements of value\***”, as they represent what the organization values in regard to behaviors, methods, and outcomes.
4. Define processes

>  If you say that you value something, but don't encourage it in any way, it creates zero results. For example, you could say that your company values transparency, but if you don't encourage transparency in any way, you have not changed any behaviors.

You say you care about people, but your actions are not coherent with it, the message you are giving is that in reality you don't care about people
