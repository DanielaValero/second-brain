How what we do today connects us to where we want to be tomorrow?




Bottom-Up scaling approach by prioritizing adaptiveness by giving their teams autonomy They work out their own goals, processes, and mechanisms to achieve the goals.




*   Get leadership buy-in and provide clear business goals
	* Have a simple hierarchy that is easy to understand and clearly links specific tasks at the dev level to larger goal
	*  One well-known company that has really exemplified structural agility is Spotify. Spotify lets its people [organize themselves into groups](http://reqtest.com/blog/how-spotify-does-agile-a-look-at-the-spotify-engineering-culture/) organized by shared objectives (squads), work environment (tribes), skills (chapters) and interests (guilds).
*   Support autonomy, encourage and empower teams to create their own way of working to deliver value and met goals
*   Encourage collaboration
*   Standardise only what is important
