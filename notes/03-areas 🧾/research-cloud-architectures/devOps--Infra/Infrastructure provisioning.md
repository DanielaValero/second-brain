## Historic background
Good read: <https://dzone.com/articles/infrastructure-provisioning-%E2%80%93>  
Summary:  
Provisioning servers for technology were traditionally:
* Buy computers, setup servers, make available, or
* Hire a service of managed hosting: you decided what you needed, then hired a service to manage it for you

Cloud computing came as the next evolution step of provisioning of infrastructure, the area is called: Cloud provisioning of infrastructure, which was a change of paradigm where no sales person was involved and all is automated.


Cloud provisioning of infrastructure is a practice of DevOps. Along with:
* CD/CI management: Automate processes of building and deploying software, they might use tools like containers (where they manage the underlying infrastructure) or serverless (where they dont)
* Version control of systems and code
* Agile software development
* Infrastructure as code (IaC)
* Configuration management of systems
* Monitoring



## Tool IaC: Terraform

Infrastructure as code tool, to build, change and version cloud services.  
Helps provisioning a consistent workflow and manage all infrastructure in a life cycle. It can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

for cloud and on-prem (On-premises data centers, commonly referred to as “on-prem,” allow you to have full control of your infrastructure, while cloud computing is cost-efficient and easy to scale up and down.)
