#reflection #humaneTech 


I have been a web developer for years, working for digital consultancy agencies who build systems that benefit financial growth only for their clients. 
I have decided to move out of that side of the industry, and move to product. I have searched for almost a year for place to work where I feel comfortable, have a deeper sense of belonging, and build humane tech products. 
I ended up in trade republic, where the mission is in that direction.


I would like to develop a new definition of success for myself, and for what it means to be successful professionally. I would like to have a new definition, one that is about building and sharing more humane technology with users of the products I build, and with colleagues.

I would like to make sense that I am not the only one succeeding, I would like to change how people think about technology, how to build technology, and build strong human relationships with my allies on this vision.


Idea:
Present the videos on these videos and share at work <3  -- maybe after work, a watch and dinner date

---

- practicing gratefulness daily

- reducing alcohol and treating myself with more self care and love

- sharing love and gratefulness, and respect with those around me

- nurture with love my current relationships, grow them

- share more knowledge and ideas about humane technology and kindness

- stop jumping into leadership, go at my own pace, slow is good

- there are going to be always crisis, and I am resistant to these crisis, I support fairness and justice, I help to create shared understanding,
