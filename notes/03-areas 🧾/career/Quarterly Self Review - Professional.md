# Quarterly Self Review - Professional Self-Insight
#career #self-insight

**A**m **I** **G**rowing **C**omplacent **C**urrently

- **Accomplishment**: Have I done anything noteworthy these last three months?

- **Impact**: Would I write a line in my resume about the work I have done over these three months? Would I value this specific work experience if I was hiring for my own company?

- **Growth/Future alignment**: Have I acquired valuable insights or skills? Are these skills aligned with my future goals?

- **Challenge**: Have there been days when I was thinking about a work problem in the shower so profoundly that I forgot if I used the soap or not?

- **Community**: Am I excited and happy to go to work every morning and see my teammates. Do I believe in the mission, vision, and leadership of this team or company?

#### Less than 40% a quarter means action

**Reinventing myself**

What, specifically, do you want to learn? The first step in developing your board is a rigorous self-assessment. Where are you headed professionally, and what skills do you need to get there?

Whom do you respect most? Once you’ve developed your list of skills, write down the people you know and respect who possess them. Think broadly — they could be peers, senior leaders, or even (like Phillippi Ryan’s mentor) interns or junior employees.

How can you arrange to spend more time with them?

How can you make the relationship reciprocal?

How are you adapting to the new reinvention curve?

How do you stay comptetitive and relevant?
