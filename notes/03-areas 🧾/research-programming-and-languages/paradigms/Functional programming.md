Writing code in “stateless functions”. A _stateless function_ takes in data and outputs it without changing the global state

> Functional programming is a programming paradigm where you model everything as a result of a function that avoids changing state and mutating data. We will discuss concepts such as state and data mutability and their importance in subsequent sections, but for reference:
> 
   > consider **state** as one of the different permutations and combinations that your program can have at any given time during its execution
   > 
  >  **data mutability** is the concept where a given dataset might change over a given course of time during program execution.
