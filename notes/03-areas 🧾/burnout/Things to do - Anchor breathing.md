1. Imagine being on a boat, feeling calm, and safe
2. Attached to the boat is an anchor. It keeps you there, where you want, and happy
3. Our bodies, like the boat, also have anchors, and they can help us focus. Our belly, our nose and mouth, and our chest and lungs can help us feel grounded.
4. With your hands on your chest, breathe in deeply
5. Breathe out slowly
6. Feel your ribs rise and fall
7. As your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the anchor point.
