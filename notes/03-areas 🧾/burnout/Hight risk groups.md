- Notably, however, anyone passionate about what they do is at high risk of burnout, especially high performers. "Because I love and appreciate my work, my mental “immune system” had nothing to reject."
- Underrepresented groups are at high risk because on top they have to manage micro aggressions
- Clark says, “Burnout for white, upper-middle-class millennials might be taxing mentally, but the consequences of being overworked and underpaid while managing micro aggressions toward marginalized groups damages our bodies by the minute with greater intensity
- Another at-risk group for burnout is working parents, especially as the number of families in which both parents worked outside the home doubled over the last 30 years.
- Women report higher levels of burnout. One study identified gender inequalities in the workplace as a key element that’s impacting occupational mental health. Women were found to have lower levels of decision-making authority and were often overqualified for their roles, which ultimately leads to less satisfaction at work and a sense that they have fewer career alternatives. We see this frustration all the time, and it often manifests in beating oneself up. Women often think it’s their own fault that they’re not thriving.
