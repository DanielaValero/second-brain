**Practice self-compassion:

Self-compassion entails three fundamental components:  

1. Extending kindness and understanding to oneself rather than harsh self-criticism and judgment
2. Seeing one’s experiences as part of the larger humanity rather than as separating and isolating; and 
3. Holding one’s painful thoughts and feelings in balanced awareness rather than over-identifying with them 



**The “Butterfly Hug”, or “Hug of self love”**
The Butterfly Hug is accomplished by an individual wrap their arms around themselves, so that each hand touches the opposite upper arm or shoulder. They then move their hands like the wings of a butterfly, to tap their arms/shoulders in an alternating rhythm. (as an alternative, the person might just tap their knees.)
