Amidst the achievement society, we got to embrace the non-achievement parts of life. 

>"In a world of excess doing, we need to develop the capacity to mindfully choose not to do.  This is far from easy, as it means confronting deeply held beliefs, many cultural and personal, that have served us well to date: “Time is money.” “If it’s not done perfectly, it isn’t worth doing.” Even the tyranny of the seemingly positive “Carpe Diem” in which we must make every moment count."

We need moments of not doing; we need moments that don’t count.
