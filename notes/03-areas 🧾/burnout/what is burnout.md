Maslach, Leiter, and Jackson defined burnout as a “psychological syndrome emerging as a prolonged response to chronic interpersonal stressors on the job. The three key dimensions of this response are overwhelming exhaustion, feelings of cynicism and detachment from the job, and a sense of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment.” Although these three dimensions—_exhaustion_, _cynicism_, and _professional efficacy_—helped us understand the negative outcomes of burnout, it remained a challenge to reliably detect them in ourselves and others.
