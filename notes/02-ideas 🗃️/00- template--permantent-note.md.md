topic: // is the name of the index note

---


- has permanent id
- should be atomic, one idea per note
- between 180 chars  and an atomic essay (300 - 500 words)
- tag: which contexts will I want to stumble upon when I read this note?
- add it to index note: If I were to find this information in a bookstore, which section would I find it under?


Finding a name for the sufix of the note name:
-   “What ideas does this permanent note spark?”
-   “If this existing permanent note were used to write an article, what information is missing?“
-   “What does this idea remind me of that I’ve read before?”
