Moving on Limiting beliefs in tech teams and communities

Idea:
- Being a person from a minority group, and having 'made it' in Germany, has required a lot of work and time
- In times I feel the lack of empathy from people who are not or have not been part of minority group, judging me harsh... In contrast, I have got in times lack of empathy to understand where they come from, therefore becomes more difficult for us to find a way to meet in the middle.
- In technology, there is a stereotype of the developer who programs since they are kids, and all they have done with their life, or private life is to code. If a developer does this, it means they are good and successful. However, the world is more complicated than that
- Software systems are analogous to the social systems developed by those who are building them. It is as good, and as needed to have in a team a person who can tell you from the brain all the functions available in Array or can traverse a binary tree, as the person who has more intuitive knowledge on it, and has as well social skills.
- In order to move on the stereotype, as Aristotle said in the quote below, we need to have more people from diffirent backgrounds in technology, and embrace different types of intelligence, compentence and strengths. Doing this, would make it easier for a person in a minority group to move on their own self limiting beliefs, and for the person who is not in a minority group to understand the need and value that others bring to the table.


> [Aristotle](https://aeon.co/essays/what-can-aristotle-teach-us-about-the-routes-to-happiness) wrote about the process of developing the right character traits, or virtues, and he recognised that this could take years of work, supported by immersing oneself in the right sort of community and following the right sort of role models
