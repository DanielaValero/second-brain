Hello folks,

This is an ongoing practice that I am currently (end of 2022-beginning of 2023) adopting, to build a [second brain](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/).

## Goal
One of the things I've learned about myself, is that I value knowledge, and intellectual stimulation.  
I have been nurturing my intellect for many years with different topics, such as web development, software architecture, psychology, Philosophy, sociology, math, culture dynamics, etc.

Yet I've done it constantly, I've done it without a structure, and without making my knowledge somewhat accessible to other people who might be interested on the things I come up with.

The goal of this initiative of mine, is to bring a structure, and to be able to create more actionable out of my knowledge, as well as have a pool of knowledge for me to use as reference for any thing I build in the future.

### Methods
This is a personal adaptation of [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) and [P.A.R.A](https://workflowy.com/systems/para-method/#:~:text=PARA%20is%20a%20methodology%20for,categories%20that%20make%20it%20up.).

I've also added some extra folders, such as diagrams-and-media, or reference system, to be able to have a place where I put mind maps, sketches, or sources to books or papers, that I want to have a space for.

### Workflow
#### Adding a new note
1. Add a daily note for any new idea, research or so I am doing
2. Within few days, move it to inbox, and process the note, update it, add tags. Let it sink
3. Few days later, move it to any if the other folders (ideas, areas, projects or reference system)


#### Producing an output
There is nothing I have here, but few ideas I want to try:
* Setting up a scheduled time per week to go through the projects, add tasks, and plan the work, so that I deliver something, and close the project

#### Housekeeping
Try:  
Setting up time per week to review notes, clean them up, update categories, etc.

### Removing notes
I am not sure how this works yet, or how I want to do this. Perhaps I could have an archive folder for projects (which is the only folder with 'deadline'?). Or maybe an archive folder for topics I am no longer interested?
