# Tech-Assessments: Questions-only interview
#career #interviewing 



A type of technical assessment that some companies do, is to make a verbal interview.  
Some companies might ask about your experience, and digg into the specifics of the projects, out of them gather information about where you are technically.

Other companies prepare a list of topic specific questions, such as: What is a closure in JS? What is a Generic in TS, and what is good for?

None of the different types of technical interviews are inherently bad, nor good. All of them serve a purpuse, and help the company to find out where is the person, technically speaking.

Here some ideas about this interview

Good for:
* Figuring out the cognitive knowledge of the person with regards of software engineering
* Might be a good form of screening, and filtering out some candidates. However, this should be taken with a pintch of salt, due to the limitations highlighted below.
* Companies who are in need of building software in a more academic perspective, where all the engineers have to match the traditional stereotype of a good engineer: has rational brain completely informed about technical concepts, traverse a binary tree, etc.

Limitations:
* Having cognitive knowledge about software engineering is not an indicator of what the candidate can actually do. A student from CS has a lot of cognitive knowledge about software engineering, however when putting this knowledge into practice, they usually have limitations. 
* There are multiple types of engineers, some people have a fully infomred brain with all the concepts, somes don't. Having a question only interview about technical topics, will make difficult to find the candidate who doesn't have all the names in, or the names of the things that you have asked, but is a good engineer who can deliver value, and diverse ideas to your team.
