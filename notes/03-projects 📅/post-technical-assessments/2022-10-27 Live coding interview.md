# Tech-Assessments: Live coding interview
#career #interviewing 



-   I rush to start coding
-   I become too nervous when I don't know something
-   I get stuck there...

  

Solutions

-   Feedback from Beamery dev, go slower and solve/write the things that I already know
-   Build on it
-   Once I get to the point I am stuck: diagram, draw and be ok to be slower and draw things out, till I understand it

  

Other reflections

-   I got feedback to learn of matheus and be more humble and less stuborn... Understand first then be understood: the approach of the guy of the interview felt a bit condescending at times, but the end result was good. I slowed down to learn the basics.. Dejan told me the same: what is the hurry? --- take my time, take low profile and learn from the others, so that I relearn the basics  and rebuild my foundation.
-   My goal is to work with AI, ML, or any of the sort technologies... Deep high level software... 
-   should I study again?
