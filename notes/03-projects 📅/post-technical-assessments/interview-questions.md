## As an interviewer or intervewiee
- What do you like most and you dislike most about what you do?

**1. How will I fail?**
can clue you into whether or not the person who’s interviewing you has truly thought about your success in the role

**2. How do you incentivise your team?**
tells what is important for the person
Red flags if the incentives are unfair, unattainable, or not well thought through.

**3. Can you share an example of something the team did that didn’t go well, and what did you do to course correct?**

helps you learn is whether or not the team and leadership have thought about principles and values, how they communicate and uphold those, and how they work to hold a high bar. 
The second thing this question can do is help you understand if the team is rewarded for thinking like scientists

### Screening

 1: Tell me about the highest-impact project you've done recently. 

“Tell me about a time you acted quickly without enough information.” -> If the candidate explains a situation in a way which demonstrates that they have (and understand) *bias for action*, they are more likely to be hired.

2: What were the goals, and how did you deliver on them? 

 3: If you replaced yourself with any other PM at the company, how would the outcome of the project have been different?

3 additions from me: 1. Tell me specific moments that you felt celebrating in the PM role? 2. What things do you not like to do? 3. Tell us things didn't go the way you wanted, or a project that didn't turn out how you had hoped.

Great answers:  1: Clearly articulates a high-impact project.  2

: Shares specific milestones and metrics, while giving credit to the team.  

3: Cites their specific impact and unique contributions, but does not over-congratulate themselves.
