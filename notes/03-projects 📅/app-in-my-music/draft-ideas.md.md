#pet-project , #idea-to-refine #build-for-fun #music 

The main idea of the app is to be a web browser app, made with whatever tech I decide, to practice, and learn full software design, and product design. At my own pace, with or without help of others. To have my own thing that I grow over time.

It would solve my need of:
* Finding new music
* Finding something in my music sources, according to: mood, genre, occasion, rather than only by title of playlist, artist name or album. 
* Recommend and promote alternative, indie-web-like, new music, new music sources (ie: flow state, fip radio, etc)
* Find in those whatever they are playing
